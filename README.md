# sonicmovie2_twitter_blocklist
Hello dear blue blur fans, this is a shared block list to prevent spoilers of sonic movie 2 as much as possible

the list includes known accounts that are known to post spoilers of the movie content (especially screenshots and post-end credits) 

# Philosophy 
the only motivation with the list is to prevent users from being spoiled by these users. 
<b><i>no personal harassment or threats towards the listed accounts is intended with this use of list.</b></i>

# How to use
It used to be twitter has an ability to export block lists of someone to a csv and it can be given to another twitter user way back in 2015. However, this feature has been removed in 2020 along with a major redesign on their web client. 

Unfortunately, as of right now the only suggestion is to quickly load their profiles in the list and block them as fast as possible. STRONG WARNING : some accounts may have spoilers on their pinned tweet.
